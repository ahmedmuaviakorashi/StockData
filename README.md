# Stock Data Extraction and Visualization

## Summary
This project demonstrates how to extract and visualize stock and revenue data for **Tesla (TSLA)** and **GameStop (GME)**. Using Python libraries such as **yfinance**, **BeautifulSoup**, **Pandas**, and **Plotly**, the project fetches historical stock prices and quarterly revenue data, cleans and organizes the data, and plots interactive charts to analyze trends over time.

During the analysis:
- Tesla's stock price data from its IPO in 2010 to June 2021 was collected.
- GameStop's stock price data from its historical trading period to June 2021 was collected.
- Quarterly revenue data for both companies was scraped and cleaned to remove missing or malformed values.
- The data allowed visualization of stock performance in relation to revenue trends, identifying periods of growth, dips, and market volatility.
